                                openSheet = false
                            },
                            onUpdateMonth = { month, year ->
                                val calendar = Calendar.getInstance()
                                calendar.set(Calendar.MONTH, month)
                                calendar.set(Calendar.YEAR, year)

                                openSheet = false

                                monthValue = " ${
                                    SimpleDateFormat("MMMM").format(calendar.time)
                                } - $year"
                            },
                        )                      
            }                                                    
```

Adding month picker in your app as a dialog.

              var openDialog by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
              if (openDialog) 
              {
                        MonthPickerDialog(
                            onCancel = { openDialog = false },
                            onUpdateMonth = { month, year ->
                                val calendar = Calendar.getInstance()
                                calendar.set(Calendar.MONTH, month)
                                calendar.set(Calendar.YEAR, year)

                                openDialog = false
                                monthValue = " ${
                                    SimpleDateFormat("MMMM").format(calendar.time)
                                } - $year"
                            },
                        )
